# About

The Iris flower data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (setosa, virginica and versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.
Data were collected by Edgar Anderson, two of the three species were collected at the same place, day and measured by the same person.
